** Specs and how they extend

These specs are extended from the base state.

When we find a specsheet such as [[https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/capella/beacon-chain.md#beaconstate][the Capella spec]] we only need to implement the changes from the base state.

It's nice to keep a link to the relevant part of the docs in your code for later reference.
